   Comparing sales generated through deposits and cash purchases to understand the impact of purchase behavior on overall revenue.

3. **Which models and versions drive the most revenue?**  
   Breaking down sales by vehicle model and version to determine the top-performing configurations.

4. **How does sales performance vary across countries?**  
   Visualizing sales and gross profit across different geographic regions to identify the most profitable markets.

5. **What are the key drivers of gross profit?**

This project demonstrates a variety of technical and analytical skills, including:

- **Data Transformation and Preparation**:  
   Cleaning and transforming sales data, ensuring correct data types (e.g., parsing the period as a date) for analysis.

- **Data Visualization with Power BI**:  
   Creating interactive and dynamic visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, column charts, and map visualizations, to highlight key sales insights.

- **Data Analysis**:  
   Using filters, slicers, and drill-through features to enable deep-dive analysis of sales across multiple dimensions (e.g., model, purchase type, country).

   Displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, gross profit, and average price to provide immediate business insights.

- **Storytelling with Data**:  
   Crafting a narrative around sales performance to present clear recommendations for improving sales strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights derived from this sales report, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Focus on Cash Purchases**:  
   Cash purchases account for a significant portion of sales. Marketing strategies should emphasize the benefits of immediate purchase options to increase revenue in the short term.
   
2. **Leverage High-Performing Models**:  
   Models such as the "75D AWD" and "75 RWD" consistently drive higher revenue. Expanding the availability of these models in key markets could boost sales.
   
3. **Expand in Profitable Regions**:  
   The report shows higher profitability in markets like the US and Germany. Investing in marketing and operational expansion in these regions is recommended to capture additional sales.Whatever marketing strategy is working in the US, should be applied to other regions

4. **Optimize Pricing Strategies**:  
   The gross profit analysis suggests that certain model configurations (like the "90D AWD") generate higher profits. The company should explore pricing strategies that balance affordability with profit maximization.
